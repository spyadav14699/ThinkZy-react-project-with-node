# Guidline 

First clone the repo. Then another terminal you can start the server with the help of 
Nodemon server.js

$ cd backend
$ nodemon server.js




In back-end I used bycriptjs and jwt.

With the help of the same if user is admin so he can update the data

 I used mongodb atlas for the same.

There are 3 route 


1 localhost:5000/product
2 localhost:5000/user/sighnup
3 localhost:5000/user/login

And also you have many methods to perform the operation



# How to use backend 


In user type some details are required you have to meke the post request in
 localhost:5000/user/sighnup

After sighn up

You have to again make the post request on 
Localhost:5000/user/login
After the you will get the token for details

If the user is admin he can meke the any request method

Go to postman make the get request on URL localhost:5000/product

In auth section choose the barrertoken option and past the url there

Then you will get the same data.


Also you can update and delete the data as well if you are a admin



Due to Lake of time and some errors I got so I was not able to impiment these things.


But I will update it soon with the full functionality.



# From end Guidline.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

I have also diployed the project I about section you can check it
.

But for now. 
I used fakestoreapi data for the details.

For now if you are running it in your local machine you can use localhost:5000/product
At the place of api.


It's a fully functional web app with the clean UI


# What is was not able to do in this project.


I was using redux for the handling cart page data.
But the reason was my system is very slow I tried to do so but it make my system hang again and again.
